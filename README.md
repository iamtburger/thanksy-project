# Thanksy

This a silly little project I wanted to do for a while and I thought would be a good opportunity to practice.

When you are working in a corporate environment, or either in a small company, saying "Thank you!" can make a difference.
When I was working for a retail chain, there was a habbit of giving out "Thank you cards" to people who have gone the extra mile, who helped you out when it wasn't really their job.
But saying thanks in the email did just not cut it, but buying a bottle of wine and a box of bonbons would have been a bit too much.
For this occasion you can just create a digital version of the Thank you card that you can download and share with your colleague!

## Planned functionalities:

-   Insert gif into card (with removed background image)
-   Choose your own style for the card (typography, additonal backgrounds)

## Refactoring and styling:

-   Improve state management
-   Form validation
-   Optimize mobile version
-   Write tests
